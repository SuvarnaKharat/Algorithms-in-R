#Decision Tree

#Assignment


#About the data: 
#  Let's consider a Company dataset with around 10 variables and 400 records. 
#The attributes are as follows: 
#??? Sales -- Unit sales (in thousands) at each location
#??? Competitor Price -- Price charged by competitor at each location
#??? Income -- Community income level (in thousands of dollars)
#??? Advertising -- Local advertising budget for company at each location (in thousands of dollars)
#??? Population -- Population size in region (in thousands)
#??? Price -- Price company charges for car seats at each site
#??? Shelf Location at stores -- A factor with levels Bad, Good and Medium indicating the quality of the shelving location for the car seats at each site
#??? Age -- Average age of the local population
#??? Education -- Education level at each location
#??? Urban -- A factor with levels No and Yes to indicate whether the store is in an urban or rural location
#??? US -- A factor with levels No and Yes to indicate whether the store is in the US or not
  
#  Problem Statement:
#  A cloth manufacturing company is interested to know about the segment or attributes causes high sale. 
#Approach - A decision tree can be built with target variable Sale (we will first convert it in categorical variable) & all other variable will be independent in the analysis.
